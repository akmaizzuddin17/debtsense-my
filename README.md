# DebtSense MY — AI Financial Intelligence

> Malaysia's AI-powered personal financial threat intelligence system.
> Detects debt risk, guards spending, and grows wealth — powered by 5 Gemini AI Agents.

**Project 2030: MyAI Future Hackathon | Track 5: Secure Digital (FinTech & Security)**
*Organised by GDG On Campus UTM — "Advancing the Nation by Building Solutions with Google AI"*

## Problem Statement

Malaysia loses **millions of ringgit annually** to digital fraud and financial scams. The highest-risk targets are Malaysians trapped in debt spiral — high DSR, low savings, and no financial safety net. These individuals are the primary victims of predatory lenders, fake investment schemes (Skim Cepat Kaya), Macau Scams, and Ah Long operations.

DebtSense MY solves this by building **financial resilience as a layer of digital security** — helping Malaysians understand their vulnerability profile before scammers exploit it.

## The 5-Agent Multi-Agent Pipeline

All agents run sequentially via a streaming SSE pipeline. Each agent feeds context into the next.

| # | Agent | Role | Output |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | DSR Analyzer | Calculates Debt Service Ratio vs BNM 60% limit | DSR %, status (SAFE/WARNING/DANGER), headroom in RM |
| 2 | Risk Profiler | Full financial risk assessment | Risk score 0-100, savings rate, emergency fund analysis |
| 3 | Purchase Advisor | "Should I buy X?" verdict | BUY / WAIT / AVOID with concrete action steps |
| 4 | Investment Matchmaker | Maps user to Malaysian investments | 4 ranked picks (ASB, EPF, REITs, gold, stocks) |
| 5 | Rescue & Growth Planner | Personalised 3-month roadmap + Financial Twin | Month-by-month action plan + personality archetype |

Additional agents:
- **Scam Detector** — 3-dimension forensic analysis of suspicious messages (Technical, Psychological, Structural)
- **Fraud Vulnerability Profiler** — Assesses money mule risk and predatory loan exposure
- **Tax & Zakat Optimizer** — LHDN relief calculator + Zakat pendapatan estimator

## Architecture

```
User Input (Browser)
      |
React Frontend (Vite + lucide-react)
      | POST /api/analyze  (SSE stream)
Express Backend (Node.js)
      |
  Multi-Agent Pipeline (sequential)
  Agent 1 (DSR) -> Agent 2 (Risk) -> Agent 3+4 (Purchase+Investment, parallel) -> Agent 5 (Plan)
      |
  Server-side post-processing (arithmetic never trusted to AI)
      |
  Shield Score calculation (pure math, server-side)
      |
Vertex AI API + Gemini 2.5 Flash (@google-cloud/vertexai SDK)
      |
Google Cloud Run (asia-southeast1, min 1 instance)
      |
RM1,200 Google Cloud Credits (hackathon budget)

## AI Disclosure

This project uses AI coding assistance (Claude Code by Anthropic) for frontend/backend development. All AI-generated code has been reviewed, tested, and understood by the developer. The core AI intelligence of the product itself uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** exclusively, as required by the hackathon's Google AI Ecosystem mandate.

---

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Gemini API key from Google Cloud Console (associated with a Google Cloud project)

### Step 1 — Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akmaizzuddin17/debtsense-my.git
cd debtsense-my

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend && npm install && cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Step 2 — Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Gemini API key
```

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
PORT=3001
```

### Step 3 — Run Locally

Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1 — Backend:**
```bash
node backend/server.js
# Running on http://localhost:3001
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Deploy to Google Cloud Run

### Prerequisites
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated (`gcloud auth login`)
- Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- Vertex AI API enabled in the project

### One-command deploy:

```bash
# Build frontend first
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..

# Deploy with Vertex AI (no API key needed — Cloud Run uses Service Account)
gcloud run deploy debtsense-my \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region asia-southeast1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --min-instances 1 \
  --set-env-vars GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your_project_id \
  --port 3001
```

**Note:** The backend automatically uses the Cloud Run Service Account for Vertex AI authentication. No API key needed in production. All charges go against your Google Cloud billing account (or free credits if available).
